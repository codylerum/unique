Unique
================

Unique aims to create a link:https://github.com/twitter/snowflake/[Twitter Snowflake] like identifier.

The result is a signed 64 bit long broken down as follows

* bit 64 -  Sign just like in java
* bit 63-23 - Timestamp in milliseconds utilizing same arbitrary EPOCH.
* bit 22-19 - 4 bits of Data Center ID
* bit 18-13 - 6 bits of Server ID
* bit 12-1 - 12 bits Incrementing sequence

Care must be taken to ensure the server has accurate time (ntp).

Separate instances must use different datacenter/server id combinations. Assignment and coordination
is on you.
